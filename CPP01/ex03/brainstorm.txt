Feature: HumanA (Always Armed)
Mechanism: Uses a Reference (Weapon&).
Initialization : Must be given a Weapon in its constructor.
Can it be NULL? :

"No, it can't. A reference is just another name for an existing object. 
It must refer to something.
Why:

The design choice is for when an object's component is mandatory. 
HumanA is incomplete without a weapon.(it cant refer to something that does not exist)



Feature: HumanB (Maybe Armed)
Mechanism: Uses a Pointer (Weapon*)
Initialization : Is created without a Weapon. One can be set later.
Can it be NULL? :

Yes, it can. A pointer holds a memory address, 
and it can be set to NULL to mean "points to nothing".
Why? :

The design choice is for when a component is optional. 
HumanB can exist perfectly fine without a weapon.
